Udemy course project to learn React

## Details
This is an app to create listings for the properties (selling / renting). It is a part of the [React Front to Back Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/).

I was mostly interested in the main functionality without some of the features, that is why there is no live demo (the app is functioning locally however).

Same as with the [Support Desk](https://github.com/Dimterion/Support-desk) project, I'm planning to restructure this project and create something else out of it if I have the time (in that case it will be done as a separate repo).

I'm keeping this one as a course project reference with the main code structure for now.

## Built with

React, React Router, Firebase, Prettier
